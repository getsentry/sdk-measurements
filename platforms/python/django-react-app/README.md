# Django Demo Application

## Running

To run this project just run `docker-compose up --build`
This will start the Django backend at http://localhost:8000
and the React frontend at http://localhost:3000/app

If you want to run the backend with a different configuration have a look at the example
in the Dockerfile: https://github.com/getsentry/demo-app-django-react/blob/main/Dockerfile#L4-L10
